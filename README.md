# Stellar-Classification-using-Machine-Learning.
This project focuses on classifying celestial objects — Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars (QSOs) — using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which provides photometric and spectral measurements for astronomical objects.
